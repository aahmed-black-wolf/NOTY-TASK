# React Todo App with Notifications API and Cypress Tests

This repository contains a Todo application built using React and Cypress for testing. The app allows you to manage your tasks with features such as adding, deleting, appending, and pausing tasks. It also leverages the Notifications API to provide timely reminders and notifications for your tasks.

## Key Features

- **React:** The application is developed using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It offers a modular and efficient approach to creating interactive components.

- **Cypress:** The repository includes Cypress, a powerful end-to-end testing framework for web applications. It allows you to write comprehensive and reliable tests to ensure the functionality and stability of your Todo app.

- **Vite:** The project utilizes Vite, a fast and efficient build tool for modern web applications. Vite offers a highly optimized development experience by leveraging ES module imports and providing instant feedback during development.

- **Notifications API:** The Todo app integrates the Notifications API to provide notifications and reminders for your tasks. You'll receive timely alerts, keeping you informed about upcoming or overdue tasks.

- **Task Management:** The app enables you to add, delete, append, and pause tasks. You can easily create new tasks, remove completed or unnecessary tasks, append additional information or subtasks, and pause tasks that require a temporary hold.
